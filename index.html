	<h3>About this site</h3>
	<p>Welcome to the website where I share my love for one of my favourite hobbies: Gunpla building. What started out as a single curious purchase in 2018 has now become an obsession.</p>


	<h3>About Gunpla</h3>
	<p>The word Gunpla is a portmanteau of "Gundam plastic model"<br><br>
		The Gundam anime franchise first started in 1979 with Mobile Suit Gundam. In 1980 Bandai started producing plastic models for the series and they became very popular. 
		Bandai's Gunpla kits have changed quite a bit since 1980, they no longer require glue or paint and are fully articulated. 
		Bandai has also seperaed Gunpla into several different grades and lines depending on detail and scale. I'm not going to go into detail about the different lines here, 
		but there are plenty of videos like <a href = "https://youtu.be/Idm7mt98enM">this</a> that do a better job of explaining them than I can. 
	Gunpla building is an extremely fun and relaxing hobby, the only things you need to start is a kit, a pair of nippers, and some patience. Anyone can build.</p>
